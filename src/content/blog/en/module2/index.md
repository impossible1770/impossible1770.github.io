title: "Correct modularization in your Android project — Part 2 (Navigation)"
description: "The best way to approach navigation in your project is to create an abstract structure that doesn’t rely on a specific implementation, such as FragmentManager, Cicerone, NavComponent, etc. A common challenge in planning navigation is the potential for circular dependencies, as features may have navigation requirements with each other."
